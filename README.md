# Radiation Image Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification Using a Gaussian Process Prior

## An example code for the paper, "Radiation Image Reconstruction and Uncertainty Quantification Using a Gaussian Process Prior". The package "imager" can be used for the imager reconstruction and uncertainty quantification methods presented in the paper. The notebook included is an example measurement scenario where an anisotropic Gaussian source and a ring shaped source distribution is reconstructed in a single detector mapping.
